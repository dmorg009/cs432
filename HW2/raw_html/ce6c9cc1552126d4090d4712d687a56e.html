<h2>About me:</h2><img src="HPIM0235.JPG" width="25%" height="25%" border="0" alt=""><br><br>
<strong>Hello.</strong><br><br>
My name is Chuck Cartledge.  I am a perennial student.  An adjunct professor at Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia and Tidewater Community College, Virginia Beach, Virginia.  I strongly believe that the field of computer science continues to change,
and that everything that we learn or are taught has a half life of about 3 years.  Because of this
 belief, I have spent what some consider to be an inordinate amount of time going 
 back to the education well and replenishing my skill set.
 <br><br>
To paraphrase the old adage "the more tools you have in your tool bag, the fewer problems look like nails." (See Maslow for the true quote.)

<!-- BTW: One of the things that I've noticed and haven't figured a way around is that SlideShare seems to not support PPT animations (for instance on slides 5 and 8 of the presentation) and some clicks to external pages (for instance on slide 20).  Inside Powerpoint, clicking on the graph on slide 20 will take you to the Youtube video shown here: -->

<!-- The movie starts off with a baseline graph that alternately gets attacked and repairs itself. Nodes that are isolated from the graph are shown in red, while those that are still connected to at least one other node are shown in cyan.  This game goes on for 10 turns just to show how a graph can be evaluated to quantify how long it will last given that some nodes become isolated and then try to regain membership into the larger graph.  These are some of the ideas behind the paper. -->

<h4>How DOs preservation copies are spread across a set of hosts (from a host's perspective).</h4>
<object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/pxC4YCE9ITY?hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/pxC4YCE9ITY?hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>
There are 1,000 DOs that desire to have at least 3 and no more than 5 preserved copies of themselves.  Each host can have at most 5 preservation copies, and an unlimited number of locally owned/supported DOs.  As each DO is added to the system, it is assigned to a host (a blue line going up) and (hopefully) a copy is preserved (red line going down).  Both DOs and copies appear to be spread across all hosts evenly randomly.
<h4>How DOs preservation copies are spread across a set of hosts (from a node's perspective).</h4>
<object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/YbDVX6tO5F4?hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/YbDVX6tO5F4?hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>
There are 1,000 DOs that desire to have at least 3 and no more than 5 preserved copies of themselves. A "wandering" DO will make connections to "fixed" DOs and then attempt to preserve copies of itself on the hosts that those fixed nodes live on.  If the host has room available, then a copy will be preserved there.  If the host does not have room, then the "originators" of the preserved copies will be queried to see if they have met their minimum desired number of copies.  If the originator has met that minimum goal, then the originator will sacrifice one copy on that host to make room for the requesting DO.  The number of preservation copies that a DO can have will grow from 0 to the minimum and then drift from the minimum to the maximum.  The number of copies will never go back below the minimum.
