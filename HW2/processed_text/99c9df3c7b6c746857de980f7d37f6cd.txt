Research Priorities
2024 Minerva Topics of Interest
Below represents the Minerva Research Initiative topics of interest for the 2024 funding competition. In framing any Minerva proposal, it is important to articulate the basic science contribution of the research proposed. It is expected that all proposals will have sufficient area and subject-matter experience to appreciate the nuances of diverse local contexts—including the (ethical) challenges posed by different value systems—and proposers are strongly encouraged to review the 2019 Future Directions in Social Science report on the Emergence of Problem-based Interdisciplinarity as a reference for the program’s strong interest in supporting projects that are disciplinarily diverse and committed to addressing problems in innovative ways. It is also expected that proposals utilize both qualitative and quantitative approaches and include validation strategies of the research findings and potential impacts. Further, the program is interested in how the theoretical and methodical approach of the proposed research is generalizable such that it could influence how similar problem sets are approached.
Successful proposals will in some clear way align with the most recent National Defense Strategy . In addition, there is strong interest in research proposals partnered with Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Minority Serving Intuitions, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and other appropriately diverse teams, such as Professional Military Education Institutions, especially as they contribute different perspectives on the social dynamics of the challenges posed below.

Future Directions in Social Science
The Future Directions Workshop series, sponsored by the Basic Research Office in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, seeks to examine emerging research areas that—in the natural and formal sciences—are most likely to transform future technology capabilities and—in the social sciences—innovatively inform about how the social world works.
