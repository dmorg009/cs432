Thank you for visiting my website. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Old Dominion University . I joined Web Science and Digital Libraries Research Group (WS-DL) under the supervision of Dr. Jian Wu in August 2019.
My research project is mining book-length scholarly data, such as Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs) using Artificial Intelligence techniques, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. Besides WS-DL, I am also a member of Lab for Applied Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing Systems (LAMP-SYS) and a former executive member of Computer Science Graduate Society .
I received my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from Elizabethtown College in 2018. While studying at Elizabethtown College, I worked with Elizabethtown College Institutional Advancement as a Database Assistant. I also served the Department of Computer Science as a Teaching Assistant under the supervision of Dr. Joseph T. Wunderlich . Before joining ODU, I worked as an Application Performance Engineer at Resource9 Group, Inc. in New York. I was an executive member of the National Society of Black Engineers and a member of The National Society of Leadership and Success . I also received Sigma Pi Sigma from the American Honor Society in Physics and got awarded Dean's List Honor in 2016.
