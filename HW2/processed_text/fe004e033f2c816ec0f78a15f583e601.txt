5. 4 Sample sets – 1000 URIs eachExperimentSampling Techniques5
6. Sampling TechniquesDMOZAll the available DMOZ history: 100 snapshots made from July 20, 2000 through October 3, 2010Remove duplicates, non-HTTP, invalid URIS
8. Sampling TechniquesDeliciousWe used Delicious Recent random URI generator (http://www.delicious.com/recent/?random=1) on Nov. 22, 2010 to get 1000 URIs.7
9. Sampling TechniquesBitlyBitly URI consists of a 1–6 character, alphanumeric hash value appended to http://bit.ly/
10. Random hash values were created and dereferenced until 1,000 target URIs were discovered8
11. Sampling TechniquesSearch EngineRandom Sample from Search Engine technique [Bar-Yossef 2008]
12. The phrase pool was selected from the 5-grams in Google’s N-gram data.
13. A random sample of these queries was used to obtain URIs, of which 1,000 were selected at random.9
14. Experiment10For each sample set, we used Memento Aggregator to get all the possible archived copies (Mementos).
15. For each URI, Memento Aggregator responded with TimeMap for this URI.Example<http://memento.waybackmachine.org/memento/20010819194233/http://jcdl2002.org>;rel="first memento";datetime="Sun, 19 Aug 2001 19:42:33 GMT“, <http://memento.waybackmachine.org/memento/20011216220248/http://jcdl2002.org>; rel="memento"; datetime="Sun, 16 Dec 2001 22:02:48 GMT",
17. We have 3 categories of archivesInternet Archive (classic interface)Search engine Other archivesArchive categoriesUKUS12
18. • Internet Archive•Search Engine• Others ArchivesMemento Distribution, ordered by the first observation date.
19. Memento Distribution, ordered by the first observation date.
20. (14.6% archived >= once per month)How often are URIs archived?
21. (14.7%  archived >= once per month)(31% archived >= once per month)(28.7%  archived >= once per month)(14.6% archived >= once per month)How often are URIs archived?
22. What affects the archival rate?URI source (More popular – More archival)BackLinks (Weak positive relationship)Archive CoverageInternet Archive (Best)Search Engine (Good), but only one copy.The other archives cover only a small fraction with recent copies.Analysis17
