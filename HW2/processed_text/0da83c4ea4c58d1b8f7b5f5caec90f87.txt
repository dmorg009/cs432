Accessibility
Carolina is one of the nation’s few public flagship campuses to practice need-blind admissions and make the promise of a Carolina education possible for all students who earn admission, regardless of their financial means.
For nearly two decades, The Carolina Covenant has offered lower-income students who earn admission the opportunity to graduate debt-free. Starting in fall 2024, Carolina will cover out-of-pocket costs for tuition and mandatory fees for North Carolina undergraduates whose families make less than $80,000 per year and have typical assets.

Diversity
At Carolina, diversity and inclusion are about celebrating all members of the community, broadening our collective understanding and fostering a sense of belonging by uplifting different identities, cultures, experiences and perspectives.
Outreach and Service
Students, faculty and staff dedicate thousands of hours each year to helping our communities by performing service projects and participating in outreach programs. One hundred and fifteen students graduated as Buckley Public Service Scholars in 2024, logging more than 63,000 hours of public service.
Carolina also had nearly 65 advisers of the Carolina College Advising Corps serving 81 high schools to support North Carolinians and help students find colleges where they will thrive.
