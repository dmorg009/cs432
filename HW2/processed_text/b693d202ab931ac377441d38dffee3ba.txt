Minerva-USIP Peace and Security Predoctoral Scholar Fellowship
Minerva has partnered with the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) to offer the Minerva-USIP Peace and Security Predoctoral Scholar Fellowship for doctoral candidates at US universities working on topics related to peace, conflict, security, and stability. The Minerva-USIP Peace and Security Predoctoral Scholar Fellowship is a non-residential fellowship that seeks to support PhD candidates in US universities working on dissertations in USIP and Minerva’s focus areas. The program supports fellows that are in the research/fieldwork and writing stages of their dissertation.
These awards compliment the success of USIP’s Peace Scholar Fellowship Program , expanding support for advanced graduate students and creating opportunities for policy and national security engagement.
