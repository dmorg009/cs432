CSC 205/208: Discrete Structures and Computer Organization
Dual enrollment instructor, Northern Virginia Community College and Fairfax County Public Schools, 2022
Through a partnership between Northern Virginia Community College and Fairfax County Public Schools, dual enrollment courses allow high school students to earn credit toward their high school diploma and college credit at the same time. I met the credentialing requirements necessary to be considered faculty by earning my masterâ€™s degree in education and 18 additional graduate credits in computer science. Discrete Structures and Computer Organization is a year-long course.
