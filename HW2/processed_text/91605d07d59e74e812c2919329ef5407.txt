About Me
I earned a Master’s of Science in Computer Science from Old Dominion University with the Web Science and Digital Libraries (WS-DL) Research Group. I started the program in Fall of 2021 and completed the program in Summer of 2023. Before pursuing my MS degree, I earned my BS in Computer Science at Liberty University in May 2021. I specialized in Web and Mobile Development and Software Engineering.
While I earned my Master’s degree, I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) on the CoSAI (Collaborative Software Archiving for Institutions) team which is funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation . As a part of this team, we developed a decentralized, federated framework for institutional archiving of research software and other open scholarly materials.
