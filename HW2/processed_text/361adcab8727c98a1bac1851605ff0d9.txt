Think. Communicate. Collaborate.
Create. …for meaningful lives.
“To think, communicate, collaborate and create” is not only what we strive to teach students, it’s the environment we seek to provide for faculty and staff so that they may do their best work.
“Think” refers to analytical and creative thinking, to reflecting, to connecting ideas. “Communicate” encapsulates written, oral, visual and digital fluencies. “Collaborate” recognizes that most research and learning experiences require the ability to work cooperatively toward a shared goal. “Create” means producing knowledge as well as inventing techniques or materials; it embraces performance, composition and art.
“…For meaningful lives” refers to the empowering effects of education and self-knowledge. It recognizes that a broad and deep liberal arts education provides perspective, context and understanding. It recognizes that today’s students will likely have multiple careers — and our job is to provide the foundation that permits them to adapt, to excel, to explore the unexpected path.
