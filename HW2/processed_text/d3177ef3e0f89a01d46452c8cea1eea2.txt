The UNC School of Education is committed to realizing the transformative power of education and is, in turn, redefining what it means to educate. Our community of dedicated researchers, practitioners, students and alumni take leading roles in their work to ensure educational opportunity for all.
Education propels the world
The UNC School of Education works to address the most pressing, persistent and complex educational questions and issues through cutting-edge research, educator preparation, innovation and community engagement. That work takes a wide view of education, drawing from a number of scholarly fields in an effort to inform and advance educational practices, programs and policies. We strive to image better futures for all learners and educators. We do so in support a society where transformative education is accessible to all, lifelong and lifewide, and where well-being, health and prosperity are within everyone’s reach.
