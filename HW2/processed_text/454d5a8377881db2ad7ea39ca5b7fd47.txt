Join the UNC Hussman School of Journalism and Media for the Price Cone Liptzin Lecture with Whitney Shefte, award-winning former senior video journalist for The Washington Post.
Whitney Shefte is a Peabody, Murrow and Emmy Award-winning independent documentary filmmaker and video journalist who worked for The Washington Post for more than 17 years. She is most passionate about character-driven, vérité-focused projects about a range of social issues. Whitney’s work has taken her all over the world to tell stories across coverage areas. She documented the war in Ukraine, climate change in Greenland and the aftermath of the genocide in Rwanda. She has also covered myriad issues across the United States from abortion access to immigration to education.
The Visual Communication Alumni-in-Residence Series was created in honor of Mary Jane Price and Annie Cone Liptzin, alumnae who volunteered for nearly a decade to assist with the needs of the UNC Hussman visual journalism program beginning in the 1980s.
