Active Tar Heels
Carolina varsity athletes aren’t the only ones competing in Chapel Hill.
Thousands of Tar Heels find plenty of ways to stay active through student groups, Campus Recreation’s Sport Clubs program and intramural sports. With a variety of teams, ranging from quidditch to tennis to wallyball to flag football, it’s easy to find a sport that is a good fit for you.
From pools and climbing walls to fitness centers and expeditions, UNC Campus Recreation is ready to help members of the Carolina community hit their fitness goals this semester.
