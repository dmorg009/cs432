History of the University
The University of North Carolina was the first public university in the nation. In 1789, William Richardson Davie wrote the act that established the University. In 1793, he and fellow trustees laid the cornerstone of the first building, Old East. Students arrived in 1795, and UNC became the only public university to award degrees in the 18th century.
The School of Law was established in 1845. Other graduate programs began in 1876, followed by a summer school for teachers in 1877 and a medical program in 1897. Over the next century, leaders broadened the mission of the University to include research and public service. Professional schools were established as follows:
School of Pharmacy (1897), now the Eshelman School of Pharmacy (2008)
School of Education (1915)
School of Commerce, now Kenan-Flagler Business School (1919)
School of Public Welfare, now the School of Social Work (1920)
School of Library Science, now the School of Information and Library Science (1931)
Institute of Government, now the School of Government (1931)
School of Public Health, now the Gillings School of Global Public Health (1936)
Division of Health Affairs (1949)
School of Dentistry (1949), now the Adams School of Dentistry (2019)
School of Journalism, now the Hussman School of Journalism and Media (2019)
School of Nursing (1950)
In 1922, the Association of American Universities (AAU) admitted UNC as a member, an acknowledgment of its growth in research and graduate programs.
In 1931, the North Carolina General Assembly established a Consolidated University comprised of the Chapel Hill campus, Woman’s College at Greensboro and North Carolina State College at Raleigh. In 1972, it created the UNC system, joining 16 state colleges and universities under a president and board of governors.
