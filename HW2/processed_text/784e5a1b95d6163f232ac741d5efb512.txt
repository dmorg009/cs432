About the University
The nation’s first public university is at the heart of what’s next, preparing a diverse student body to become creators, explorers, innovators and leaders in North Carolina and throughout the world.
Carolina’s nationally recognized, innovative teaching, campus-wide spirit of inquiry and dedication to public service continue the legacy that began in 1795 when the University first opened its doors to students.
In Chapel Hill, students develop a voice for critical thought and the courage to guide change. They connect to the future they’re already shaping. Carolina is committed to access for all, providing life-changing opportunities such as the Carolina Covenant, which promises a debt-free education to low-income students.
In its third century – an era of groundbreaking study and research – UNC-Chapel Hill is harnessing the very best of our fast-changing world. We’re proud to advance knowledge for this and each generation to come.
