Each post highlights key points distilled from longer, empirically-based research that Minerva-awardees have published. Content appearing in the Owl in the Olive Tree does not constitute Department of Defense policy or endorsement by the Department of Defense, but does highlight the diversity of voices it seeks out in its effort to engage researchers on security-related topics.
