Meet Torin Simpson
Passionate percussionist
I started my journey with percussion way back in middle school, and I was so excited to continue it into college. It was a no-brainer to join the Marching Tar Heels. Playing that music and getting to experience that camaraderie has been one of the most gratifying things I’ve been a part of. The experience has given me so many incredible opportunities, my personal favorite of which was when we all got to participate in the halftime show for Carolina’s 2022 football game against Florida A&M University.
My time with the Marching Tar Heels has driven me to be a better leader. It has allowed me to engage in many extracurriculars, such as my role in club flag football and volunteering at UNC Hospitals Hillsborough Campus Emergency Department. Carolina has provided me with a diverse set of opportunities that encourages trying different things.
I hope the Heelprint I leave is one that inspires people to grow and to be grateful for the time they have here.
