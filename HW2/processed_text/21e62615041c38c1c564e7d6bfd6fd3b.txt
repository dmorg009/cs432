I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Old Dominion University, where I conduct research within the Web Science and Digital Libraries Research Group. My scholarly interests center on the intersection of human-computer interaction and machine learning, with a specific emphasis on accessibility. Motivated by the goal of creating inclusive technologies for individuals with disabilities, I strive to translate theoretical research findings into practical solutions that meet the needs of diverse user populations. My responsibilities also include serving as a graduate teaching assistant, which has allowed me to refine my pedagogical skills and mentor emerging scholars in computer science. Looking ahead, I am eager to leverage these combined research, teaching, and leadership experiences to pursue an academic or industry-oriented role focused on advancing equitable digital solutions. By continuing to explore innovative applications of machine learning in accessibility contexts, I aim to contribute substantively to the development of user-centered technologies that benefit society at large.
