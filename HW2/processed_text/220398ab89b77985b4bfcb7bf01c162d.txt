About Me
I am a Bullard Postdoctoral Fellow at The University of Texas at Austin, collaborating with Dr. Jacek Gwizdka.  My research interests are in the fields of Eye-Tracking, Human-Computer Interaction, Human-Information Interaction, Data Science, and Machine Learning. My current research leverages neuro-physiological evidence to deepen our understanding of human-information interaction.  As part of my fellowship, I plan to explore the use of real-time cognitive load detection algorithms in applied contexts.  By monitoring cognitive load in real-time, adaptive systems could dynamically personalize user experiences, adjusting task difficulty, providing additional resources, or introducing challenges tailored to users’ cognitive states.
I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Old Dominion University in 2024, where I built a strong foundation in eye-tracking, pupillometry, and neuro-physiological signal analysis. My dissertation introduced an advanced eye movement analysis pipeline to extract and analyze positional gaze and pupillometry measures in real-time.  I also developed algorithms to generate advanced gaze metrics that capture cognitive load and ambient/focal viewing behaviors, providing deeper insights into cognition and attention allocation.
I received my BS (Computer Science) from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.
I’m open for faculty positions in Computer Science, Information Science, and Data Science, or industry positions in Research and Development.
