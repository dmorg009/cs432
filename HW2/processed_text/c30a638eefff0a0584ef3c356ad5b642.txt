Providing leadership and excellence in patient care, education and research
To be the nation’s leading public school of medicine is not just a lofty statement. It is a very real promise to our students and the people of North Carolina.
We are extremely proud of both the laudable teaching effort that our professors make in our clinics and lecture halls, as well as the hard work our students put in to their academic study and clinical skills each and every day.
