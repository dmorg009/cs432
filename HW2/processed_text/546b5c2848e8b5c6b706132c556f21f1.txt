University Research Grants
The Minerva Research Initiative primarily funds social science basic research by university-led research teams.
Research teams range from single investigators to large multi-university consortia, and all awarded projects are expected to be funded for at least three years (and in some cases--pending availability of funding--eligible for an extension up to five years).
See Research Priorities for the topics of interest.
