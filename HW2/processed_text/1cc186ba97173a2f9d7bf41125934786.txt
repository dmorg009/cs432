Tar Heels
“It’s a great day to be a Tar Heel,” or #GDTBATH, is often proclaimed by many at Carolina — and for good reason. Every day, Tar Heels are creating a positive impact on the world by improving communities and inspiring change through their extraordinary talents. They’re creatives, scientists, humanitarians, athletes, researchers and innovators doing great things.
As the new year gets underway, meet some of our students, alumni and staff to find out why every day truly is a great day to be a Tar Heel.
