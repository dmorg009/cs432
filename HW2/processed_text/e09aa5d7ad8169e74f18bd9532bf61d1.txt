Dr. Sawood Alam <salam@cs.odu.edu>
The CS 431/531 Web Server Design course focuses on complete understanding of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and implementation of a web server (not a web application).
The course is programming intensive, prerequisites include the understanding of network (socket) programming.
Students in this course decide their own implementation language within the Unix/Linux environment; the lectures are about HTTP and not about any particular programming language.
