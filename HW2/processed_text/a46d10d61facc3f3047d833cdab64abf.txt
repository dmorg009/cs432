NO FEAR ACT
Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act
DoD
        Directive 1440.1, DoD Civilian Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Program - At sub-section 5.2.7, of
    this document (page 6) the Secretary of Defense assigns to the Heads of DoD Components the responsibility to
    "ensure fair, impartial, and timely investigation and resolution of complaints of discrimination in employment,
    including complaints of sexual harassment" by implementing the procedures outlined in sub-section 6.2.4 (page
    8). Each DoD Component, therefore, has its own discrimination complaint program and process, to include the issuance
    of final agency decisions and the payment of judgements, when appropriate.
